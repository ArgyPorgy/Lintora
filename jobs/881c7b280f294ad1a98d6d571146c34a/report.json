      "description": "The withdraw function can be called by any address because there is no access control. It triggers selfdestruct, permanently destroying the contract and sending any ether balance to the uninitialized owner variable (zero address). An attacker can instantly destroy the contract, causing loss of all funds and rendering the token unusable.",
